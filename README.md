# ADB Tool

A Compose Desktop application for managing Android devices via ADB. This is currently a work in progress and subject to change over time. Features that I plan to support are:
* Taking screenshots
  * Compressing/Processing
  * Auto-framing with device frame images
* Recording Screen
  * Auto-process via Handbrake or ffmpeg
  * Auto-GIF
* Intent builder
  * UI for composing Intents for testing
  * Catalog to save these intents
  * Templates
  * Export/Import
* Wireless ADB connecting
